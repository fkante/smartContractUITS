# Smart Contract UI

### **Welcome 👋**
This a weekend project made to learn some Solidity.
Here I wrote + deployed a smart contract to the blockchain, and build a Web3 client app to interact with the contract.
This project is comprised of the front, react App and the back with the solidity smart contract

### Deployments
Smart Contract is deployed to Rinkeby ethereum test network at 0x5ce8e2B3695665FD91dF29a6D84618deb0B87504 @ https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x5ce8e2B3695665FD91dF29a6D84618deb0B87504
React App is online at https://smartcontractuits.fkante.repl.co/

To wave at me you'll need to connect your wallet
